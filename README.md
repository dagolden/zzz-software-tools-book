=======================

This repository contains programs based on the code from Software Tools in
Pascal by Kernighan and Plauger.

Currently, I am using it to explore programming in Go.  I fully expect my
early efforts to look like "baby Go".  Hopefully, it will improve with time
as I get more familiar with the language and its libraries.

I may add Perl examples for comparison.
